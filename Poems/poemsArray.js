    "author" : "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow",
    "text" : "The night is come, but not too soon. And sinking silently, All silently, the little moon. Drops down behind the sky. There is no light in earth or heaven. But the cold light of stars; And the first watch of night is given. To the red planet Mars. Is it the tender star of love? The star of love and dreams? O no! from that blue tent above, A hero’s armor gleams."

    "author" : "Gerard Manley Hopkins",
    "text" : "Look at the stars! look, look up at the skies! O look at all the fire-folk sitting in the air! The bright boroughs, the circle-citadels there! Down in dim woods the diamond delves! the elves’-eyes! The grey lawns cold where gold, where quickgold lies! Wind-beat whitebeam! airy abeles set on a flare! Flake-doves sent floating forth at a farmyard scare! Ah well! it is all a purchase, all is a prize."

    "text" : "The Wain upon the northern steep. Descends and lifts away. Oh I will sit me down and weep for bones in Africa. For pay and medals, name and rank, things that he has not found, He hove the Cross to heaven and sank. The pole-star underground. And now he does not even see. Signs of the nadir roll. At night over the ground where he is buried with the pole."

    "title" : "Relativity - for Stephen Hawking",
    "author" : "Sara Howe",
    "text" : "When we wake up brushed by panic in the dark our pupils grope for the shape of things we know. Photons loosed from slits like greyhounds at the track reveal light’s doubleness in their cast shadows that stripe a dimmed lab’s wall—particles no more— and with a wave bid all certainties goodbye. For what’s sure in a universe that dopplers away like a siren’s midnight cry? They say a flash seen from on and off a hurtling train will explain why time dilates like a perfect afternoon; predicts black holes where parallel lines will meet, whose stark horizon even starlight, bent in its tracks, can’t resist. If we can think this far, might not our eyes adjust to the dark?"

    "author" : "Edith Södergran",
    "text" : "On foot I had to cross the solar system before I found the first thread of my red dress. I sense myself already. Somewhere in space hangs my heart, shaking in the void, from it stream sparks into other intemperate hearts."
